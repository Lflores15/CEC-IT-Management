## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables

The environment variables are defined in the `.env.dev` file and used by Docker Compose to configure the database.

Example `.env.dev`:

```
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root
MYSQL_DATABASE=cec_it_management
MYSQL_USER=test
MYSQL_PASSWORD=test
MYSQL_SERVERNAME=db

USER_LOG_PATH=/var/www/html/logs/user_event_log.txt
DEVICE_LOG_PATH=/var/www/html/logs/device_event_log.txt
```

Make sure to copy `.env.dev` and rename to `.env` so that all environment variables work with application.
